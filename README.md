# Starbucks Capstone Project
This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. Starbucks is interested to study previous marketing offers and their impact on different types of customers in order to better directing their marketing strategies. The dataset used in this project contains simulated data that mimics customer behaviour on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). 


## Installation
No libraries are needed other than the ones provided by Anaconda. The code was built on Python 3.
